To run:

```
  $ npm install
  $ cd <project-folder>
  $ http-server .

  Navigate to localhost:8080
```

Development notes:

- I went with the most barebones approach possible, using just vanilla html/js/css, with a couple of imports for fonts and nice styling. For production work I'll almost always use React/Rollup/SCSS and other standard frameworks.
